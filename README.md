Hello there, I'm Davide 👋
</h1> 

I'm a web developer based in Italy. 
I usually work as a frontend dev, but I have no problem as a full stack with MERN or PERN stacks.
In my free time I love contributing to open source libraries, for now I was able to contribute in [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui), [Headless UI](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui), [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com) and [Flowbite](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react)

Feel free to contact me by [email](mailto:davide@sophany.it)!
